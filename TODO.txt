FIX: Sometimes the game starts out with a black screen.
	Not sure why, happens randomly it seems. Maybe a race condition?

FIX: Sometimes the height counter doesn't start when the timer ends. The game just kinds stops, but the music is still playing.
	Again, not sure why. Happens randomly it seems.

FIXED: Weird physics when sped up, by changing Engine.physics_ticks_per_second to (Engine.time_scale * 60)

FIXED: Couldn't click on presents after adding UI. Fixed by changing Mouse->Filter to Ignore or Pass (not Stop) on all UI elements.
